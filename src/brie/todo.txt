fix bug where recent show same file many times

space nav pill -> right click: find in space (so don't need to open file to do it)

If file is opened in file view but file exists in pod view - open it in pod view ??
-> or if opening  folder in file view that is a pod, the juts open it has a pod (show pod icon in file nav ?)

File space -> Make new source root checkbox ? -> -> what if alreday in source roots
file view / dir -> Open as new space
file space -> show only name rather than full path (full path on rollover)

when file nav is used, highlight current file and stay on it (not reset navbar each time)
or when open file -> highlight in navbar / scroll to

Bocce: Ctrl+A -> select all

pod view -> Specific pod : customize root ? (for example from /camembert/src/brie/ to /camembert)

If detecting a buildgroup type build.fan, present that as pod collection(folder) in podl ist, then can open if (file view)
