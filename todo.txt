   (gains focus but do not act on the keystroke)

console: process tabs, repeat command etc ... ?

build group icon should stay yellow in space bar

allow folding/unfolding folders in pod space nav
allow to use patterns for folders to autoexpand (ie: fan/** test/**)

separate fantom config from editor config
make support fantom a plugin ?

better plugin speration

"pluginize" help pane -> allow search in html, javascript, java docs etc ...

Move away from const space to allow more efficient refresh and not having to rebuild space constantly.

  etc ...

  "run", "f5", ["$fan"], interactive = true (can edit params)  -> memorize(mem/disk) or ask each time ?
                                  interactive -> NO, ALWAYS, ONCE, ONCE_PER_PROJECT ?, ONCE_PER_SESSION
  "build", "f4", ["$fan", "$dir/build.fan"], "$dir"
