[TODO / Ideas]

(1) -> Reimplement Fantm indexer using projectRegistry for sources

(1) -> Fix help pane (SWT sigterm crahes :-/ )

(1) Optimize template / license lookup (toStr equals)

(1) Finish the nav collapse/expand using the pattern

(2)** make license on camembert level ... free but some plugins require it to be licensed ?

(3) -> theme swicther without whle config reload ? (store in frame/session not in config)

(3) nav -> auto-open folders: <10(10 children or less) ; *(all); .fan, .axon(olders wth .fan or .axon); fan(folder)
always expand folders that contain sub projects ?

(3) "run custom" commands ? -> or i guess can just reuse run single ??

(3) reimplement switch config

(3)**console:
process tabs, repeat command etc ... ?
separate fantom config from editor config
make support fantom a plugin ?
instead of "gray" area when no file, open a "blank" file ?
run -> terminate any existing process ??
or maybe have process list somewhere
separate console from search results ??
reimplement terminate in here

(3) Menus
nav -> same .... but quick search / goto would need to be plugin specific or moved
process -> mve all that inside plugin ? or delegate to plugin ? -> terminate : move to console area X
.... or keep them there but have them call out to plugin specific impls ???
plugins -> remove
plugin[1] "Fantom" .. swicth env
plugin[1] "Axon" (End : fantom_env), import, licensing, about etc ...

(3) when deleting cur fle, closeeditor or go to prev file

(3) ** Indexing
each plugin -> reindex option (remove reindex from status bar)

FantomPodIndex ->   // TODO: key by path to allow multiple version of same pod ??
fix project finder for axon plugin using new indexer

(3) TrioInfo -> should be in Axon plugin

(4) duplicate sources -> provide a way to pick which to use  ?

(4) Goto in filespace/axon space -> list of files
goto -> use :25 instead of 25 for go to line ?

(4) autosave option (when swicthing screen ?? )

(4) always have new line at end of file on save

(4) make nav sidebar sash resizable ?

(5)**splits screen: horizontal / vertical ? (own file browser or shared ??)
manyally -> open in side panel ??

(5) undo/redo at file level ?

(3) ** better plugin speration
"pluginize" help pane -> allow search in html, javascript, java docs etc ...

(5) ** ant projects, maven projects (graddle etc..), play ? and so on
 node support
 java support(ant, maven. graddle etc ...)
 ruby, php, etc ...
