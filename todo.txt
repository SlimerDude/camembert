[Axon Plugin]

axonPlugin -> specify an env where to find documentation (pods)
axon -> pull/edit rules
axon -> new faxon file -> validate/fix func name, requires lower case first letter !

*************************************************************

[TODO / Ideas]

(1) -> generalize env / plugin support ?

(1) -> show current env(if any) in status bar (upon switch space / chnage env)

(1) Finish the nav collapse/expand using the pattern

(1) Upon new file -> tree does not refresh properly !

(2)** make license on camembert level ... free but some plugins require it to be licensed ?

(2) config wizzard / getting started

(3) -> theme swicther without whle config reload ? (store in frame/session not in config)

(3) nav -> enhance for java projects ... flat not so good here, to many subfolders

(3) nav -> auto-open folders: <10(10 children or less) ; *(all); .fan, .axon(olders wth .fan or .axon); fan(folder)
always expand folders that contain sub projects ?

(3)**console:
process tabs, repeat command etc ... ?
separate fantom config from editor config
make support fantom a plugin ?
instead of "gray" area when no file, open a "blank" file ?
run -> terminate any existing process ??
or maybe have process list somewhere
separate console from search results ??
reimplement terminate in here

(3) when deleting cur fle, closeeditor or go to prev file

(3) TrioInfo -> should be in Axon plugin

(4) duplicate sources -> provide a way to pick which to use  ?

(4) Goto in filespace/axon space -> list of files
goto -> use :25 instead of 25 for go to line ?

(4) autosave option (when swicthing screen ?? )

(4) always have new line at end of file on save

(4) make nav sidebar sash resizable ?

(5)**splits screen: horizontal / vertical ? (own file browser or shared ??)
manyally -> open in side panel ??

(5) undo/redo at file level ?

(5) ** ant projects, maven projects (graddle etc..), play ? and so on
