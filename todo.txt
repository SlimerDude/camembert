- Bocce bug: When going in the text area, the first keystroke is often lost, especially if backspace/delete ?
   (gains focus but do not act on the keystroke)

console: process tabs, repeat command etc ... ?

build group icon should stay yellow in space bar

allow folding/unfolding folders in pod space nav
allow to use patterns for folders to autoexpand (ie: fan/** test/**)

separate fantom config from editor config
make support fantom a plugin ?

better plugin speration

"pluginize" help pane -> allow search in html, javascript, java docs etc ...

Move away from const space to allow more efficient refresh and not having to rebuild space constantly.

Copy and use the syntax files in config folder
