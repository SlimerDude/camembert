## Camembert IDE

Camembert is a Free, Open source, lightweight IDE, written in Fantom.
It's multi-platform and can run on many platforms (Linux, Max, Windows...)

It supports Many languages such as Fantom, Go, Node.js ,Maven, Python, Ruby etc...

The focus is on being a fairly "simple" editor yet provide built-in access to each language documentation as well as running commands.

Over time I have found out the most advanced IDE's, while very effective, tend to make you a bit lazy and often
you will learn a **lot** more by looking at the proper API documentation than just using completion "blindly".

On the other many hand lightweight editor do not give any built-in access to the documentation at all so if you are somewhet new to a language it will be difficult.
